title: 'What is Digital Transformation'
---
Simply put, it is the process of upgrading existing processes and adopting new technology systems to meet the needs of the industry. Process, Technology, along with Data and Organizational change comprise the four main pillars of Digital Transformation. 

### Transformation, Modernization, Migration

Is Digital Transformation the same as Modernization or even Migration? What's the difference? More importantly how do I do it? Well, if transformation in this context is upgrading your processes, technology, data and organization to meet industry needs. Modernization is using that technology to properly! Making sure you fix the operations and the infrastructure. How can you do that? Cloud services: Migration.  

Transformation is somewhat holistic: Do we have all the right things; new policies; new values; right people 
Modernization: Is actually doing the do work.   
Migration: is the act of cleaning everything up.

For example, the Twitter homepage is composed through calls to dozens of microservices, including a “who to follow” microservice, a “trends” microservice, a “tweets” microservice, and many others -- some of which in turn call other microservices. The key to a successful microservices architecture is the loose coupling, which enables each microservice to be developed, tested, and released independently of the other microservices.

### Isn’t this just SOA?

Many people frequently point out that the core concepts of microservices were pioneered in service oriented architectures (SOA). While there are some technical similarities between microservices and SOA, microservices is focused on a different class of problems -- how to organizationally and computationally scale your cloud-native application architecture -- and takes advantage of cloud and DevOps technologies to create a more powerful, flexible approach to software architecture for cloud-native applications.
