Simply put, it is the process of upgrading existing processes and adopting new technology systems to meet the needs of the industry. Process, Technology, along with Data and Organizational change comprise the four main pillars of Digital Transformation. 

### Transformation, Modernization, Migration

Is Digital Transformation the same as Modernization or even Migration? What's the difference? Are you still reading? Just Checking. Well, if transformation in this context is upgrading your processes, technology, data and organization to meet industry needs, then modernization is using that technology to properly! Making sure you fix the operations and the infrastructure. How can you do that? 

An inventory your legacy systems will help you make some key decisions. Some applications might need a complete overhaul, some could involve minimal work to make use of new technologies; and then part of this inventory process is deciding if an application can be left as is or even retired. 

Our playbook details a 3 STEP - Pre Migration Evaluation. In STEP 1 we participate in an active discovery of all relevant applications that your manage and the creation of your application landscape. STEP 2 is where we evaluate the health and value of each of your managed apps. Finally in our last STEP â€” 3 we will give you options to help develop your modernization plan.
