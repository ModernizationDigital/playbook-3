title: 'What is Digital Transformation'
---
In our world, Digital Transformation is happening as we upgrade existing processes and adopt new technology systems to meet the needs of the industry. Process, Technology, along with Data and Organizational change comprise the four main pillars of Digital Transformation. 

### Transformation, Modernization, Migration

Is Digital Transformation the same as Modernization or even Migration? What's the difference? Are you still reading? Just Checking. Well, if transformation in this context is upgrading your processes, technology, data and organization to meet industry needs, then modernization, is using that technology properly! Making sure you fix the operations and the infrastructure. How?

</br>Our playbook details a 3 STEP - Pre Migration Evaluation. In STEP 1 we participate in an active discovery of all relevant applications that your manage and the creation of your application landscape. STEP 2 is where we evaluate the health and value of each of your managed apps. Finally in our last STEP â€” 3 we will give you options to help develop your modernization plan.  

This inventory of your legacy systems can assist you in making key decisions in your transformation and modernization journey. Do your apps need a complete overhaul, do some require  minimal work to make use of new technologies; or maybe our criteria will lead to leaveing your app where it is, as it is, or possibly even retiring it?
