Maybe this is the intro?

Well, let's think of this as simply as possible. A container is something you put something else in. If you were to go for a picnic it would be helpful to have a container that held everything you needed to enjoy your lunch. The food, the utensils, your napkin. Your drink. At lunchtime you open your picnic basket and you can start eating right away.

Containers in the cloud computing environment also hold everything you would need to run that specific application. Lunch containers can come in all different sizes, so now we have to shift our focus to think of a container that is always the same.  

### Containers in Shipping

In the late 1960's the International Organization for Standardization (commonly referred to as ISO) established standards for shipping container dimensions via ISO 668. Why do you think they standardized those shipping containers? 

Containers had to be standardized so that they can be efficiently stacked. Consistant sizes allow ships, trains, trucks and cranes at the ports can be specially fitted or built to a single size specification. This efficiency saves millions of dollars, and time. This makes shipping and transporation easier!  https://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/containers

Like the shipping industry, Cloud Computing has standardized containers. And this makes everyones job easier.
