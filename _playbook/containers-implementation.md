### Are Containers the right solution for you? 

At a high level, let's just do a pulse check and see if containers are the answer to all your problems. Have you looked at [Link to section about Keep, Retire, Repurchase]? If you have decided you want to keep your app, let's keep going and see how this could help you.

\### Project status

[ ] Do you want to keep your application
[ ] Do you want this done fast?
[ ] Beta Testing
[ ] Production

Some times older applications have outdated technologies, licencing agreement that limit it's re-architecture and still you need to move it to the cloud to take advantage of some of the cloud capabilies, like scaling. 

Have you looked at what is available for modernization. Is there anything else out there that can do what your app can do? An already built SAAS?

### Application migration

Containers make it easy to package your entire application and move it to the cloud without needing to make any code changes. If you want to keep your app, there isn't a prebuilt solution and you don't have the resources, or reasons to rebuild it. This would be a good solution.
