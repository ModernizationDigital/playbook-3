#### Needs imagery, checklist, diagrams, sectioning 

Choosing to containerize your app as a modernization pattern is a holistic process. We have to look at what we want to do, what we need, our effort level and what is available. We want to make sure containers is the right solution.  

Wanting and deciding to modernize your app is not the same as can. You might want to modernize your app, and it's too old. Hardware is gone, coders don't know it. Within the next decade many of your on premise solutions of the past will become obsolete, and we will not be able to find coders with the skill set to fix your hardware. 

Sometimes older applications have outdated technologies, and or licensing agreements that limit it's re-architecture and still you need to move it to the cloud to take advantage of some of the cloud capabilities, like scaling. Containers would work for this scenario.  

At the same time you want to think about your applications usership. How many people need your app?  If you have very limited users for your app it might cost less to retire the app and replace it with a SAAS product. We want to check if there is a SAAS out there that can meet your needs.  

How much work and effort are you able to invest? Containers are a great solution if you don't have the ability or resources to totally overhaul your app. With a container solution you'll have the ability to modernize your app enough to move it to the cloud and have access to cloud capabilities. It will not be cloud native, but it's a step in the right direction. Containers are also a great way to start your modernization, and then you can come back to the containerized app at a future date to see if you want to further enhance its cloud capabilities.  

With these considerations reviewed you might have decided: Yes, containers are the answer to all your problems. Now what?  

\### Key Considerations 

[ ] How do I inventory my app? [checklist of items] 
[ ] Do you want to keep your application 
[ ] How much effort am I willing to invest 
[ ] IHow do I look for SAAS products that can suit my needs? [how to source Saas] 
[ ] What purpose are you going to containerize [have to, jumpstart, quick fix till we have resources to fully enhance ] 
[ ] What are my next steps [checklist of next steps]

### Application migration

Containers make it easy to package your entire application and move it to the cloud without needing to make any code changes. If you want to keep your app, there isn't a prebuilt solution and you don't have the resources, or reasons to rebuild it. This would be a good solution.

|  can move your app to the cloud              | does not pay your technical debt  |
|  give you portability                        | does not fix an underlying poor infrastructure|
|  allow your app to use cloud elasticity (scalability) | doesn't make app cloud native |
|  allows your developers to innovate          | if your app is broken it will still be broken |
|  achieve greater efficiency                  | liscence dependencies - might prevent use |
|  allow you to attract innovative developers  | hardward dependencies - might prevent use |
|  aligns w/workforce trends.                  | technology dependencies - some tech is too old |
|  more efficiencieny development technologies | tech managed by gui (excel, ms axis) |
|  reduce tools your dev teams need            |                            |
