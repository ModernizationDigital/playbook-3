### How can I use them? 

First of all, What do you want to do with your application to modernize it? [Link to section about Keep, Retire, Repurchase]. 

The first thing to determine is Do you want to keep your application? If the answer is yes. Have you looked at what is available for modernization. Is there anything else out there that can do what your app can do? A Saas already made

[Are containers sometimes cheeper than saas, or rebuilding]

Container solutions will allow you to move your application from on-prem to the cloud.
