#### Needs imagery, checklist, diagrams, sectioning 

Choosing to containerize your app as a modernization pattern is a holistic process. We want to make sure containers are the right solution. This involves identifying: what we want to do, what we need, our effort level and what is available. 

Wanting and deciding to modernize your app is not the same as can. You might want to modernize your app, and subsequently find it's not possible. Necessary hardware might be out of circulation. What if you can't find someone who can read that particular code? Within the next decade many on premise solutions of the past will become obsolete, and we will not be able to find coders with the skill set to fix your hardware.

Sometimes older applications have outdated technologies, and or licensing agreements that limit it's re-architecture and still you need to move it to the cloud to take advantage of some of the cloud capabilities, like scaling. What about your applications usership. How many people need your app?  If you have very limited users for your app it might cost less to retire the app and replace it with a SAAS product. We want to check if there is a SAAS out there that can meet your needs.  

Containers make it easy to package your entire application and move it to the cloud without needing to make any code changes. If you want to keep your app, there isn't a prebuilt solution and you don't have the resources, or reasons to rebuild it. This would be a good solution.  

So if you've decided: Containers ARE the answer to all my problems!!! Then we'll need some details.

How much work and effort are you able to invest? Containers are a great solution if you don't have the ability or resources to totally overhaul your app. With a container solution you'll have the ability to modernize your app enough to move it to the cloud and have access to cloud capabilities. It will not be cloud native, but it's a step in the right direction. Containers are also a great way to start your modernization, and then you can come back to the containerized app at a future date to see if you want to further enhance its cloud capabilities.  </p>

  <summary markdown="span">How to source Saas product to meet your needs</summary>
<p>
<p>
Software as a service (SAAS) is an application distribution model where the software is hosted, maintained and updated by a third-party provider on their own servers and made available to organizations or individuals to be used over the internet. Examples of providers are AWS & Azure. Popular examples of Saas products are: gmail, google drive and nearly every software that runs on your browser and is targeted to the end user.  
<p>
<strong> How can Saas help you? </strong>
SaaS frees organizations like yours of the burden of hardware and software license acquisitions, and removes the need for managing software. This model enables you to “rent” an application as you us and minimizes your IT needs. 
A variety of licensing models give you better budget planning options. The pay-as-you-go model allows you to keep your operational expenses in proportion your growth. 
As a cloud application saas are easily scaled up or down with minimal costs. When your business grows or decreases you don’t have to worry much about acquisitions and implementations of hardware. 
<p>
<strong> Key Questions: </strong>

1. What are the benefits you expect to get from the intended saas model. Detail the benefits you expect to get from your saas. What are the must-haves and nice-to-haves? 
<p>

| What the Must Haves | What are the Nice to Haves| 
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | 
|                                      |                                     | 
|                                      |                                     | 

<p>
2. Is it a real SaaS? Real SaaS solutions usually just need a browser to run, and everything else is done in the cloud. 
There are hybrid solutions that might end up costing you more in the long run. The following list mentions additional work they could ask from you:  
* install special client software on, or  
* needs you to keep parts of the application on-premise,  
* And others where you need to add other products 



3. Browsers and Mobility.  
* Browers: You want to think about your saas behavior in different browsers. We can't foresee the future, but think about how different products work in Chrome vs Explorer.  
* Devices: Test or review the saas product on andriod and ios devices. It would be rare to be able to determine which product your end user will have.  
* Responsive: Is your application simple enough that your user will use their mobile device? Or is it intensive/extensive enough that they will only use desktop. Unless you answer definitively to these two questions, you may need to have a responsive/ adaptive design.  

4. Exit Strategy 
Digital advances can cause industry giants can become obsolete overnight. You want to make sure that you can protect your application as technology and trends change.  
* Can you remove your data if needed? In what format? Get it in writing 
* Will they keep a copy of your data? Is that a violation of your privacy regulations?  
* Is it open source? This will allow anyone to be able to edit, fix your code later.  

5. Saas provider support 
Read reviews to see how well their support service is.
