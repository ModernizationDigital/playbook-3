### How can I use them? 

First of all, What do you want to do with your application to modernize it? [Link to section about Keep, Retire, Repurchase]. 

The first thing to determine is Do you want to keep your application? If the answer is yes. Have you looked at what is available for modernization. Is there anything else out there that can do what your app can do? A Saas already made.

### Application migration

Containers make it easy to package your entire application and move it to the cloud without needing to make any code changes. If you want to keep your app, there isn't a prebuilt solution and you don't have the resources, or reasons to rebuild it. This would be a good solution.

| --------------------------                   | -------------------------- |
|  can move your app to the cloud              | does not pay your technical debt  |
|  give you portability                        | does not fix an underlying poor infrastructure|
|  allow your app to use cloud elasticity (scalability) | doesn't make app cloud native |
|  allows your developers to innovate          | if your app is broken it will still be broken |
|  achieve greater efficiency                  | liscence dependencies - might prevent use |
|  allow you to attract innovative developers  | hardward dependencies - might prevent use |
|  aligns w/workforce trends.                  | technology dependencies - some tech is too old |
|  more efficiencieny development technologies | tech managed by gui (excel, ms axis) |
|  reduce tools your dev teams need            |                            |
|  can still sit on prem                       |                            |
