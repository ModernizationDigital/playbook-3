Before you begin your cloud migration, you will need to designate a migration architect to lead the effort. This role is a system architect-level position responsible for planning and completing all aspects of the migration. You will need your migration architect to:

i define necessary refactoring required to make the migration successful, 
ii design strategies for data migration, 
iii define cloud-solution requirements, and 
iv determine migration priorities and production switchover mechanisms.
