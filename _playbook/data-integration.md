Before we decide what service you need, it is good to think about data. Is the application housing data? What kind of data do you have? VM's | Databases | Unstructured 
Are you using it regularly ? Do you want to keep it? Do you want to keep metadata? 
Get out of the data center business and shift from a CapEx to OpEx model of IT services?

### What do you have

Is there a lot of data? Do you need a snowball? If so they may need to co-ordinate time frames; Do they need more than one SnowBall. Most likely in Canada there are limited Snowballs in use. So you will need to make sure they are available. And you need to make sure you have the infrastructure in place to store and use Snowball. Or do you need SNOWMOBILE!!! ;-) 

Snowmobile: Watch this: maybe we can link to this in our data section.
