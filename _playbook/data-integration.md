Before we decide what service you need, it is good to think about data. Is the application housing data? What kind of data do you have? VM's | Databases | Unstructured 
Are you using it regularly ? Do you want to keep it? Do you want to keep metadata? 
Get out of the data center business and shift from a CapEx to OpEx model of IT services? 

I could go on and on and on about data, but I bet you're bored already. So lets just keep it succint. There are multiple types of data storage you might need. The big buckets are: 

### Why modernize your data? 
Legacy applications can have a lot of data. That data might be out of date. Maybe you don't need it? Who wants to be the person to get rid of it. So you're storing all this data, you might need to use. You really don't have any use for it. You can't use it.  

This is where modernization comes in. Data fuels digital transformation. So this means you need to store your data in a consumeable way. Cloud native apps have phenomenal capabilities to analyze data. So how do you get it there?  

### Data Lakes 
A Data lake is a type of data repository that stores large and varied sets of raw data in its native format. This allows you a centralized area for your data to run thru. Your data can come into your data lake from multiple sources. If properly organized it can be used to create consistent data to measure against. This is important because cloud native apps have phenomenal capabilities to analyze that data anytime you need it. Proper use of cloud data analysis can increase business insights which can drive innovation and success.

### What do you have

Is there a lot of data? Do you need a snowball? If so they may need to co-ordinate time frames; Do they need more than one SnowBall. Most likely in Canada there are limited Snowballs in use. So you will need to make sure they are available. And you need to make sure you have the infrastructure in place to store and use Snowball. Or do you need SNOWMOBILE!!! ;-) 

Snowmobile: Watch this: maybe we can link to this in our data section.
