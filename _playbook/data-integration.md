#### Data and Modernization

Data fuels digital transformation. Legacy applications can have a lot of data. Gigabytes, terabytes, pedabytes and exabytes! When you modernize your applications, you can make use of cloud native technology. Cloud native apps have phenomenal capabilities to analyze data. Proper use of cloud data analysis can increase business insights which can drive innovation and success. Sign me up!

Then how do we get our data to the cloud? The exciting video below shows how some large data transfers can happen, after that we will talk about ways to store your data, and some proven data modernization solutions.

I could go on and on and on about data, but I bet you're bored already. So lets just keep it succint. There are multiple types of data storage you might need. The big buckets are: 

### Data Lakes 
A Data lake is a type of data repository that stores large and varied sets of raw data in its native format. This allows you a centralized area for your data to run thru. Your data can come into your data lake from multiple sources. If properly organized it can be used to create consistent data to measure against. This is important because cloud native apps have phenomenal capabilities to analyze that data anytime you need it. Proper use of cloud data analysis can increase business insights which can drive innovation and success.  

### What do you have

Is there a lot of data? Do you need a snowball? If so they may need to co-ordinate time frames; Do they need more than one SnowBall. Most likely in Canada there are limited Snowballs in use. So you will need to make sure they are available. And you need to make sure you have the infrastructure in place to store and use Snowball. Or do you need SNOWMOBILE!!! ;-) 

Snowmobile: Watch this: maybe we can link to this in our data section.
