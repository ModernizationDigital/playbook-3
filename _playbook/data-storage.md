title: 'Types of Data Storages'

I could go on and on and on about data, but I bet you're bored already. So lets' just keep it succinct. There are multiple types of data storage you might need. The big buckets are: object, block & file, and they can all be stored in Data Lakes.  

i need to figure out how to put this in here. <embed> https://bl.ocks.org/HarryStevens/4fba7a62b0ff302ef49768198d4c54c6</embed>

### Data Lakes 

A data lake is not a lake. Just like your stuff isn't really in the clouds. A Data lake is a type of data repository that stores large and varied sets of raw data in its native format. This allows you a centralized area for your data to run thru. Your data can come into your data lake from multiple sources. If properly organized it can be used to create consistent data to measure against. This is important because as we mentioned on the previous page: with the right schemas applied cloud native apps can pull incredible insights from your analyzed data anytime. 

### Object Storage 

This is the fun one. Object-based storage is deployed to solve for unstructured data (videos, photos, audio, collaborative files, etc.). Sometimes called "Blob", this storage puts large or shared objects are in data containers or “buckets”.  

Collaborative software uses object storage as it works easily independent of device or interface. Truly a modern marvel. Collaborative software utilizes object storage because it works across multiple levels, from the device level to the interface. 

This storage that allows for greater flexibility and scalability. Its’s reliance on REST APIs enables access to objects via HTTP. This means it's easier to  authenticate, share permissions, and properties.
