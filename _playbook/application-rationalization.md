### Evaluate legacy systems

Application rationalization needs to be collaborative â€” engaging both IT and business stakeholders. Both parties need to come to the table. This playbook exists because your organization wants to deliver innovative and efficient customer service. Grab a coffee, fix your wigs and show up to the table. Start by booking at least 3 meetings with your PPM - each 1 hour and then just show up. Here are a few things you will need to consider.  

1. Inventory: First let's look at what you have: what relevant applications do you manage? What is the volume of use for each map? What was its intended use? Is that use still in effect?  
2. Classification: As a first pass, can you bucket your apps into three categories: do nothing, minimal enhancement needed, & major enhancements need.  
3. Define: Your enterprise will have adopted a strategy for future technology. How do you plan to adapt to that goal? A total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis that key business and IT stakeholders align on will help you determine your strategy.  
4. Placement of applications: What deployment models (cloud, on-prem, hybrid, SaaS) will your use? What future state application landscape do I need, and how do I figure out how to manage the efficient governance of the new portfolio.
