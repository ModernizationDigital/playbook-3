### Evaluate legacy systems

Application rationalization succeeds with collaboration â€” engaging both IT and business stakeholders. This playbook exists because your organization wants to deliver innovative and efficient customer service. Grab a coffee, fix your wigs and show up. Start by booking at least 3 meetings with your PPM - each 1 hour. Here are a few things you will need to consider.  

1. Inventory: First let's look at what you have: what relevant applications do you manage? It's good to create a heat map to visually understand your apps' usage. What is the volume of use for each map? What was its intended use? Is that use still in effect?

2. Classification: As a first pass, can you bucket your apps into three categories: do nothing, minimal enhancement needed, & major enhancements needed.

3. Define: Your enterprise will have adopted a strategy for future technology. How do you plan to adapt to that goal? What business objectives would you like to achieve in the next 3-5 years. A total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis that key business and IT stakeholders align on will help you determine your strategy.

4. Placement of applications: What deployment models (public, private, community, and hybrid) will you use? What future state application landscape do you need, and how do to figure out how to manage the efficient governance of the new portfolio. Do we need to talk about service models - saas, pass, iaas? maybe? highlevel.
