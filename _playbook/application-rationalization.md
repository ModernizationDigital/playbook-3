STEP 1: Application Rationalization: Evaluate legacy systems using six drivers 

Application rationalization needs to be collaborative — engaging both IT and business stakeholders. Both parties need to come to the table. This playbook exists because your organization wants to deliver innovative and efficient customer service.  

Grab a coffee and fix your wigs and show up to the table. Start by booking at least 3 meetings with your PPM - each 1 hour and then just show up. Here are a few things you will need to consider.  

#### Inventory: 
First let's look at what you have: what relevant applications do you manage? What is the volume of use for each map? What was its intended use? Is that use still in effect?  

##### Classification: 
As a first pass, can you bucket your apps into three categories: do nothing, minimal enhancement needed, & major enhancements need.  

Define: Your enterprise will have adopted a strategy for future technology. How do you plan to adapt to that goal? A total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis that key business and IT stakeholders align on will help you determine your  

Placement of applications — what deployment models (cloud, on-prem, hybrid, SaaS) will your use? What future state application landscape do I need, and how do I figure out how to manage the efficient governance of the new portfolio. 

#### Should small development organizations shy away from microservices?

Not necessarily. Even small development teams (~5 engineers) can benefit from the incrementally adopting microservices patterns. A common example is the deployment of a standalone microservice for search (e.g., Elastic Search), which enables a developer to iterate and release improved search features without requiring changes to the main application. Moreover, this design pattern allows the search microservice to be reused elsewhere.
