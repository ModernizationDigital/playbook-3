### Containers in Shipping

In the late 1960's the International Organization for Standardization (commonly referred to as ISO) established standards for shipping container dimensions via ISO 668. Why do you think they standardized those shipping containers? 

Containers had to be standardized so that they can be efficiently stacked. Consistant sizes allow ships, trains, trucks and cranes at the ports can be specially fitted or built to a single size specification. This efficiency saves millions of dollars, and time. This makes shipping and transporation easier! [Worldshipping](https://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/containers)

Like the shipping industry, Cloud Computing has standardized containers. And this makes everyones job easier.

Of Interest: For the past century the width of the Panama canal has driven the standardized size ships are built. Today, gobal warming has opened a new trade route above Canada. Last year about 20 oversized ships used this new trade route. This is the first time those oversized ships have been able to reach the west coast of North America. Now people can build bigger boats. A new trade route makes things trickier. Since 1977 the Canal has been under a permanent Neutrality agreement, meaning every country must be allowed to use it. The new Canadian route has no such agreement. With Canada's resources, real estate, financial stability, and the Raptors, who's the King of the North now?
