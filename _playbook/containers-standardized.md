### Containers in Shipping

In the late 1960's the International Organization for Standardization (commonly referred to as ISO) established standards for shipping container dimensions via ISO 668. Why do you think they standardized those shipping containers? 

This standardization allowed the containers to be efficiently stacked. Consistent sizes also allow ships, trains, trucks and cranes at the ports to be specially fitted or built to a single size specification. This efficiency saves millions of dollars, and time. This makes shipping and transportation easier! [World shipping](https://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/containers). The enormous impact of standardization in shipping, could give it weight as a modern world revolutionary feat.

  <summary>Standardization and Trade Routs!</summary>
  
  ## Heading
For the past century the width of the Panama canal has driven the standardized size ships are built. Today, gobal warming has opened a new trade route above Canada. Last year about 20 oversized ships used this new trade route. This is the first time those oversized ships have been able to reach the west coast of North America. Now people can build bigger boats. A new trade route makes things trickier. Since 1977 the Canal has been under a permanent Neutrality agreement, meaning every country must be allowed to use it. Canada's new trade route has no such agreement. a Hippie, waving a Canadian flag on a freighter ship
