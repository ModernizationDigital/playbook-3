Containers in the cloud

### Monolith

To understand how containers work, let's look at an app in our old school environment, or possibly in your current environment. Right now your app may sit in a physical server in your office. If you move it there are many things to reconfigure. This can be thought of as a 1 to many relationship. One app connected to many things. To run your app this way you need physical infrastructure. You are running your app on infrastructure. IAAS

### Virtual Machines
Or perhaps you have a VM? A virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. A computer within a computer. You can have many vm's on one computer. Each vm is it's own little computer. However this vm is dependant on the physical machine. So your vm app is still running on your monolith infrastructure. Still one to many relationship and IAAS. 

### Containers
A container is packaged with everything you need to run an application. When you run a container, you don't install anything.  It doesn't need servers, or physical hardware. This app state is considered a one to one relationship. It only needs itself. Serverless.
