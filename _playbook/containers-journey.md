#### Quick overview to help you move forward 

Like we said in the previous section, using Containers as your modernization method is somewhat of a holistic approach. We have to check if it's the right path for you. Below you will see at a high level your journey to helping you move forward with Containerization.

<strong>Step I: Learn:</strong> Do not panic! You are not getting a container today. First you need to learn about containers, and match cloud services to your application needs. This is a process and it will take a bit of time to wrap your head around the ideas and options. </p>


<strong>Step II: What do you want?:</strong> At a high level, let's start thinking about what you want to do. Is your app still relevant? Do you need the data it holds? What was it's original purpose. How much effort does it make sense to put into modernizing it? </p>

<strong>Step III: What's your effort?:</strong> How much time and how much money do you want to invest in your app? Do you have the budget to make your app fully cloud native or do you just need to get it migrated yesterday? Does your enterprise have a mandate to migrate to the cloud yesterday and you just need a finished product?</p>
