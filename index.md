<h1>The Microservices Playbook</h1>

<p class="intro">
Over the past year, the Datawire team has spent time with some of the leading cloud software companies in the world, learning about their journey into microservices. This playbook is a distillation of these learnings. Our goal in producing the playbook is to help developers think about microservices and avoid the common pitfalls that occur in adopting microservices.
