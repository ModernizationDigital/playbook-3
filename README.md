A pragmatic, opinionated guide to adopting microservices. See http://playbook.microservices.com for the latest.

# Building

The Playbook content is written in Markdown, and in the _playbook directory.

To build HTML, install Jekyll (http://jekyllrb.com/), and then type
`jekyll build` in the main directory.

For local development, run `gem install && jekyll serve` and point your browser to http://localhost:4000/playbook/.
